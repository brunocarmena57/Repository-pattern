# Bruno Repository Abstractions NuGet Package

Flexible Repository Abstractions for Custom or Base Implementations.

## Overview
The **Bruno57.Repository.Abstractions** NuGet package delivers a robust collection of repository interfaces that can be implemented across any project or data access strategy.

Whether you're building your own repository layer from scratch or integrating with a pre-existing solution, this package offers the structure and adaptability necessary to bring consistency to your data access layer.

Currently used in **Bruno57.Repository**, these abstractions are intentionally designed to be reusable and implementation-agnostic, empowering developers to:

* Define clean, predictable data access contracts

* Maintain separation of concerns

* Enable testing and mocking with ease

* Extend or override behavior for specific needs
